<p> Hi! I'm Dayna, nice to meet you!</p>
<p> I was born and raised (briefly) in Los Angeles, and (mostly) Seoul. More recently in my life, I spent a few years in New York to study at Columbia University. I studied Computer Science on the Applications track, and recently graduated in December 2022 :) </p>

<p> I am particularly excited by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Data Visualization, where I hope to illuminate meaningful, <em>human</em> stories through (otherwise lifeless) data. I am also generally interested in Technology for social good, and how software can solve intriciate societal problems.</p>

<p> In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new cookie recipes (@daynatriestocook), playing TFT, and petting dogs (and cats). I hope to get a golden retreiver one day, to address all my petting needs.</p>
