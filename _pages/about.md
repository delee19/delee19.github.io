<p> Hi! I'm Dayna, nice to meet you!</p>
<p> I was born and raised (briefly) in Los Angeles, and (mostly) Seoul. More recently in my life, I spent a few years in New York to study at Columbia University. I studied Computer Science on the Applications track, and recently graduated in December 2022 :D </p>

<p> Academically, I am particularly interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Data Visualization, where I hope to illuminate meaningful, <em>human</em> experiences through data. I am also generally interested in Technology for social good, and how software can solve intriciate societal issues.</p>

<p> I'm a matcha aficiando, and I also enjoy experimenting with new cookie recipes (putting matcha powder in any recipe I find). In my free time, I can be also found playing TFT, or petting dogs. My ultimate adulting dream is to be put together enough to parent multiple golden retreivers one day, so I can address all of my petting needs 24/7.</p>
